Profile: I'm what some might call a 'cool nerd'. I've been a gamer and avid fan of the Legend of Zelda since before I can remember. In my early teens I picked up a skateboard and never truly put it down. Fell in love with cars, became a Nissan Senior Specialist Technician (one step short of master tech), before sustaining an injury that motivated me to finally get into tech. I'm a web developer - though I don't like to sell myself as one type or another(I love it all), I'll just say that I've been on an endless mission to learn, execute, assess, and repeat since 2016.
